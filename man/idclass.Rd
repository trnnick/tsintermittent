\title{Time series categorisation for intermittent demand}

\description{Time series categorisation for intermittent demand data.}

\usage{
idclass(data,type=c("PKa","SBC","KHa","KH","PK"),a.in=NULL,
        outplot=c("summary","detail","none"),plot.focus=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
    Time series dataset. Each column is a series. Alternatively this can be a single series.
}
  \item{type}{
    Type of categorisation: 1. "SBC" - Syntetos Boylan Croston; 2. "KH"  - Kostenko Hyndman (exact*); 3. "KHa" - Kostenko Hyndman (approximate); 4. "PK"  - Petropoulos Kourentzes (exact*); 5. "PKa" - Petropoulos Kourentzes (approximate). *These are computationally expensive, as SBA is optimised for each time series. 
}
  \item{a.in}{
    Vector of SBA demand interval smoothing parameters. This must be same length as number of series. This is used for categorisations "KH" and "PK". If a.in == NULL then the parameters are calculated internally using MAR as a cost function.
}
  \item{outplot}{
    Plot results of categorisation: 1. "summary" - simlified plot that reports number of series in each class and cut-off points; 2. "detail" - scatterplot between average interdemand interval (p) and squared coefficient of variation of non-zero demand (CV^2). Series that are categorised for SBA or SES are plotted in shaded areas; 3. "none" - do not produce plot.
}
  \item{plot.focus}{
    Only relevant to outplot == "detail". Can be used to specify the maximum p and CV^2 to plot, so that the scatterplot can be focused on the separation area between the categories. Use vector of two elements. First one is max p and second one is max CV^2. Example: plot.focus=c(1.5,1.5). If NULL then maximums are defined from the dataset. 
}
}
\value{
\item{idx.croston}{Index of series that are categorised under Croston.}
\item{idx.sba}{Index of series that are categorised under SBA.}
\item{idx.ses}{Index of series that are categorised under SES. Provided only for "PK" and "PKa" types.}
\item{cv2}{Coefficient of variation squared of non-zero demand.}
\item{p}{Inter-demand interval.}
\item{summary}{Summary of number of series under each category.}
