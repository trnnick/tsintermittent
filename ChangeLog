Version 1.10 (15 July 2022)
  * Fixed checks on classes.
  * Updated links.
  * Fixed bug in crost.R and crost.ma.R when checking number of parameters to optimise. Bug did not cause issues before. 
  * Updated DESCRIPTION.

Version 1.9 (10 March 2016)
  * Provide vectors of non-zero demand and intervals for crost.R and crost.ma.R.
  * Change the variable name of demand rate in crost.ma.R to "cc"
  
Version 1.8 (23 September 2015)
  * Added "auto" method in data.frc. This selected and uses Croston, SBA and SES automatically for each time series, based on PKa classification (idclass function). 
  * Changed classification to PKa instead of PK with prespecified alpha for imapa. Note that data.frc with method="auto" and imapa with maximumAL=1 give the same results, but the data.frc is faster. Use imapa when temporal aggregation is desirable. 
  * Added check on crost.decomp and idclass when input is a data frame.
  * Added warning on functions that handle single time series when data frames with more that a single column are used as inputs.

Version 1.7 (17 September 2015)
  * Added function data.frc. This is a wrapper to forecast data frames with a single command.
  * Added option to remove NA values in all forecasting methods. 
  * simID now outputs different series as columns in a data frame. 

Version 1.6 (17 February 2015)
  * Added separate function crost.decomp for Croston decomposition.

Version 1.5 (20 November 2014)
  * Corrected optimisation error in crost.ma. 

Version 1.4 (03 October 2014)
  * Added more time series checks for crost and imapa functions. 
  * Revised default maximumAL in imapa to be floor(number of observations/2).
  * Changed default CV^2 in simID function to 0.5.

Version 1.3 (04 August 2014)
  * Corrected major optimisation bug - issue with opt.on in all crost, tsb and sexsm functions.
  * Corrected bug in imapa function when maximumAL was very high.
  * Corrected bugs in the legend of imapa function plots.
  * Added option to optimise only initial values without parameters in crost, tsb and sexsm functions.
  * Added init.opt option for imapa in the same way as it is for crost and tsb functions. This does not affect SES optimisation.
  * Added option to use pre-fitted imapa models.

Version 1.2 (16 July 2014)
  * Introduced imapa function for intermittent demand series.
  * Added MAPA package dependency for temporal aggregation functions.
  * Added parallel package dependency for imapa parallelisation.

Version 1.1 (03 July 2014)
  * Added SES function (sexsm.R) with control over parameter & initialisation.
  * Added URL in description.
  * Renamed data and data2 to ts.data1 and ts.data2.
  * Forced type input to lowercase.

Version 1.0 (23 June 2014)
  * First release.
